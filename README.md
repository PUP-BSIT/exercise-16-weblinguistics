Group Name: WebLinguistics

Description: "Hi guys! Welcome to our team's website! Our project represents our personal webpage that showcases our interests, achievements, and aspirations while allowing interaction through the comment section. What we aim for is to showcase fun facts and trivia about us to people so they can get to know us better. You can now also sort the comments whether it's on ascending and descending form to maximize the capacity of the comments. We also added a button for the list of different countries around the world to showcase the API functions. This group has really worked together to demonstrate unity and deliver quality work to achieve success. Please take a look and explore our website. Thank you very much!"
